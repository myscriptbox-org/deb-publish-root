{program} apache.servername root@myserver.com -remove-fix{br}
This command is being supplied in a policy of maintaining the ability to undo/reverse each command, when possible. A command that cannot be undone, becomes strategic. This policy tries to limit the number of strategic commands to the bare minimum possible.
